You can create your own dockerfile and then do this to prepare your dependencies.

```
FROM composer
COPY <your-src-folder> /app
RUN composer install

FROM node
COPY --from=0 /app /app
RUN yarn install

FROM oozman/laravel
COPY --from=1 /app /www
RUN chmod -Rf 777 /www/bootstrap/cache /www/storage
```

After building your dependencies, you can start containerizing your app.

```
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```
